# usage: from visionset.kernel import EntityNotFound, VisionSetError
"""Domain errors raised by the kernel.

Every error the kernel raises derives from ``VisionSetError``, so a delivery
surface can translate the whole family to an HTTP status or an exit code with a
single ``except`` clause. The kernel NEVER raises a framework exception —
``HTTPException`` and friends belong to the boundary, not here.

Only the errors the persistence layer needs live here today; services add their
own (``ProjectNotFound``, ``InvalidTransition``, ...) as they land.
